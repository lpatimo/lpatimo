        <br><i> Preprint </i>
        <br>This paper extends the methods and result of "Charges via the affine Grassmannian" to type $C_2$. In particular, we construct atomic decompositions for crystals of type $C_2$ and use this to define a charge statistic on them. This is the first case of a positive combinatorial formulas for Kostka-Foulkes polynomials outside type $A$.

        <li> 9. <a HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02564">Charges via the affine Grassmannian</a>
        <br><i> Preprint </i>
        <br>We give a new construction of Lascoux-Schützenberger’s charge statistic in type $A$ motivated by the geometry of the affine Grassmannian. 
        Using the geometric Satake equivalence, we construct the charge by understanding how hyperbolic localization changes on a family of cocharacters in the affine Grassmannian.
        Although this framework works for any reductive group, in type A there are two crucial features that make this procedure behave well:
        the atomic decomposition of crystal, which we revise here, and a technical property of twisted Bruhat graphs.

        <br><i> Adv. Math., 399 (2022) </i>
        <br>We introduce some new bases of the spherical Hecke algebras of affine Weyl groups, called the pre-canonical bases, which interpolate between the standard and KL bases. 
        We conjecture that in type A they have remarkable positive properties, namely that the (i+1)-th pre-canonical basis has positive coefficients in the $i$th basis.
        This would reduce the problem of finding KL polynomials in a sequence of easier problems. We also compute the pre-canonical bases explicitly up to rank 4.

        <br><i> Selecta Math. </i>
        <br> We study the Hecke category for the affine Weyl group $\tilde{A}_2$ in characteristic 0. 
        We determine the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis and give a recursive formula to compute the indempotent corresponding
         to every indecomposable object. Then we produce a basis of the morphisms between indecomposable objects, that we call "indecomposable light leaves."
         As a corollary, we also obtain a combinatorial objects counting KL polynomials

        <br><i> Transform. Groups</i>
        <br> We generalize to p-cells (i.e. cells constructed using the p-canonical basis) a result of Geck, called parabolic induction of cells.  In terms of cell modules, this translates to 
        the fact that cell modulex of a right p-cell in a standard parabolic subgroup decompose as a direct sum of cell modules after induction to the bigger Coxeter group. 
        A crucial point in the proof is a new positivity result of the p-canonical basis with respect of the hybrid p-canonical basis, which we introduce here.

        <br><i>  J. Algebra 589 (2022), 345–400 </i>
        <br> There are several explicit combinatorial formula that describe Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for Grasmannians, one of which, described by Shigechi and Zinn-Justin, 
        involves counting certain Dyck partitions. We ''lift'' this combinatorial formula to the intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties in Grassmannians and as a consequence obtain many
        distinguished bases of the intersection cohomology which extend the classical Schubert basis of the ordinary cohomology. These bases are an useful tool when studying 
        the intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties as a module: for example, we can write in these bases a generalization of the Pieri's formula

        <br><i> Proc. Lon. Math. Soc., 125(6), 2022.</i>
        <br> This is a revised version of Chapter 4 of my PhD thesis. Rouquier complexes are an important tool for studying Soergel bimodules and the Hecke category. 
        Here we generalise the construction of Rouquier complexes to the setting of singular Soergel bimodules. We show that they retain many of the properties of ordinary Rouquier complexes:
         they	are ∆ -split, they satisfy a vanishing formula and, when Soergel's conjecture holds they are perverse. As an application, we use singular Rouquier complexes to establish
			Hodge theory for singular Soergel bimodules. </li>

        <br> <i> Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN 2021, no. 5 </i>
        <br> We study the coefficient of q in Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. Using moment graphs, for finite groups of type ADE we prove that this coefficient 
        can be computed via a formula which only depends on the poset structure of the Bruhat interval.

        <br> <i>  Transform. Groups 23 (2018), no. 4 </i>
        <br>
         Following Looijenga and Lunts, we introduce for any Soergel module a semisimple Lie algebra generated by all the Lefschetz operators and their adjoints. 
        This algebra, called the N&eacute;ron-Severi Lie algebra, can be used to provide a simple proof of the well-known fact that a Schubert variety is rationally smooth if and only if 
        its Betti numbers satisfy Poincar&eacute; duality. We also determine a large set of elements, for finite Coxeter group, where the N&eacute;ron-Severi Lie algebra coincides with the full 
        Lie algebra of endomorphism preserving the intersection form.

	  <br> <i>  Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN 2018, no. 18 </i>
	  <br> We show that the Hard Lefschetz theorem holds for the flag variety of some reductive group in characteristic p, if p is larger than the number of positive roots.
		The converse also holds, a part from 3 exceptional cases. One can also deduce an algebraic proof of the Hard Lefschetz theorem in the already known 
		characteristic 0 case.

        <br> The thesis includes the results my first two papers. There are also two sections which are not included elsewhere.
        <ul>
        <li>We discuss Soergel modules, and we show that for infinite Coxeter groups in general Soergel modules have "more" morphisms than Soergel bimodules, and in particular indecomposable Soergel bimodules can give rise to decomposable Soergel modules. We also show that one retrieves the usual Hom formula by regarding Soergel modules as modules over the nil Hecke algebra. </li>
        <li>We generalize the results of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0791">The Hodge Theory of Soergel Bimodules (B. Elias, G. Williamson)</a>: we show that the hard Lefschetz theorem and the Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations also hold for singular Soergel modules.</li>
